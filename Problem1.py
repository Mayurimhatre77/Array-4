#I solved the problem of maximizing the sum of the minimum elements from pairs formed from an integer array. The approach begins by sorting the input list nums to ensure that the pairs are formed with the smallest elements together, which maximizes the sum of the minimums. After sorting, I initialize a variable sum to zero and iterate through the sorted list, incrementing the sum by every element at an even index (i.e., indices 0, 2, 4, ...). This effectively selects the minimum element of each pair. Finally, the function returns the computed sum. The time complexity of this solution is O(nlogn) due to the sorting step, where n is the length of the input list. The space complexity is O(n) for the sorted list n, although in place sorting could reduce it to O(1).

class Solution:
    def arrayPairSum(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        n = sorted(nums)
        sum=0
        for i in range(len(nums)-1):
            if i%2==0:
                sum = sum+n[i]
        return(sum)

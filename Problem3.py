#I solved the problem of generating the next lexicographical permutation of a list of integers by following a systematic approach. First, I identified the largest index i where the element nums[i] is less than nums[i+1], which signifies the rightmost ascent in the permutation. If no such index exists, the list is in descending order, and the current permutation is the highest; thus, I reversed the entire list to produce the smallest permutation. Next, I found the smallest index j greater than i where nums[j] is larger than nums[i], and swapped the values at indices i and j. Finally, I reversed the subarray to the right of index i to get the next permutation in lexicographical order. The time complexity of this approach is O(n), where n is the length of the list, due to the linear scans and reversals. The space complexity is O(1) since the operations are performed in-place without using additional space.

class Solution:
    def nextPermutation(self, nums: List[int]) -> None:
        for i in range(len(nums)-2,-1,-1):
            if nums[i]<nums[i+1]:
                break
        else:
            return nums.reverse()

        for j in range(len(nums)-1,i,-1):
            if nums[j]>nums[i]:
                nums[j],nums[i]=nums[i],nums[j]
                break
        nums[i + 1:] = nums[i + 1:][::-1]
